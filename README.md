# 📱 V Mobile: Subscriber Behavior & Campaign Analytics

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This end-to-end data solution was developed to address a critical business problem at **V Mobile**, a mobile operator running a *“free minutes”* promotional campaign.  
Marketing lacked visibility into campaign performance — including who qualified for rewards, their geographic distribution, and behavioral patterns.

The project involved building a **complete data pipeline** — from raw, disparate data sources to an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize marketing strategies and increase subscriber value.

## 🎯 Business Problem

V Mobile's marketing team faced several key challenges:

- ❌ **No Single Customer View:** Subscriber data was fragmented across three different systems (V Mobile, BlueMobile, ArrowMobile) after an amalgamation.  
- ⚙️ **Manual Qualification Tracking:** No automated process existed to identify subscribers generating ≥ R30 in weekly revenue.  
- 📉 **Lack of Strategic Insights:** Marketing had no analytics to understand which subscribers were most valuable or where they were located.
